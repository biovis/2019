## Call for Participation: BioVis@ISMB 2018
**Community of Special Interest (COSI) event at [ISMB 2018](https://www.iscb.org/ismb2018)**  
**Date: {{ site.ISMBconferencedate }}**  
**Location: Chicago, USA**


### Aims and Scope

The rapidly expanding field of biology creates enormous challenges for data visualization techniques that enable researchers to gain insight from their large and highly complex data sets.

BioVis @ ISMB is an interdisciplinary event covering all aspects of visualization in biology. Organized as a <a href="https://www.iscb.org/communities-of-special-interest">Community of Special Interest (COSI)</a>, BioVis @ ISMB brings together researchers from the visualization, bioinformatics, and biology communities with the purpose of educating, inspiring, and engaging visualization researchers in problems in biological data visualization as well as bioinformatics and biology researchers in state-of-the-art visualization research.

We invite submissions of original research articles as well as abstract submissions.

### Symposium Format

BioVis will be a one-day single-track event at [ISMB](https://www.iscb.org/ismb2018). The event will feature keynote talks, paper and abstract presentations, and posters/demos. 
 

### Topics

We invite contributions on all aspects of data visualization in biology, from molecular to cell, tissue, organism and population biology. Suggested topics for paper and poster submissions include, but are not limited to:

 * Genome and sequence data, including genomic variation data
 * Multivariate omics data (transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, etc.)
 * Phylogenetic data
 * Biological networks and pathways
 * Biological ontologies
 * Macromolecular structures (e.g., protein or RNA structures)
 * Biological image data, such as microscopy data
 * Integration of image and omics data for systems biology
 * Modeling and simulation of biological systems
 * Neurobiology and developmental biology
 * Systems and software frameworks
 * Biological workflows or collaborative processes
 * Usability of visualization by biologists
 * Biological atlases and metadata
 * Processes for interdisciplinary collaboration between biology and visualization.

### Submission Types and Criteria

There are several possibilities to contribute to the program of BioVis:

1. ISMB Proceedings - Submission Deadline: January 29, 2018
2. Abstracts - Submission Deadline: April 5, 2018; Late Poster Submission Deadline: May 1, 2018
