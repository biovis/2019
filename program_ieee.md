## BioVis Challenges Workshop Agenda

### Workshop Scope
The number of individuals in studies that are collecting clinical, genomic, and other biomedical data has been growing rapidly in recent years. For example, the [UK Biobank](https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/) currently makes data for 500,000 individuals available and the National Institutes of Health [All of Us Program](https://allofus.nih.gov/) aims to collect data on a million individuals over the next few years. Similar data collection and organization efforts are also taking place at hospitals and private companies in the pharma and healthcare sectors. The breadth of these collections is also growing significantly with the increasing availability of different data channels and personal sensors, adding new layers of richness and valuable information.

In this workshop, we will discuss what unique data visualization challenges visualization of data from such studies are posing and how the visualization community can contribute to the success of those studies. This will include questions focused on visual design and interaction, but also technical and legal challenges related to data access, for a broad range of data types and driving biomedical questions.

### Workshop Goal
The goal of the workshop is to lay the groundwork for a position paper on challenges and research opportunities for data visualization in large heterogeneous collections of clinical, genomic, and other biomedical data. Workshop organizers and interested workshop participants will collaboratively refine the results of the discussions after the event and write this position paper. At a minimum, all participants will be acknowledged for their contribution.
