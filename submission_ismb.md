## Submission Types and Criteria
There are several possibilities to contribute to the program of BioVis @ ISMB:

## 1. ISMB Proceedings - Submission Deadline: January 29, 2018

Novel, unpublished work can be submitted as a paper to the ISMB Proceedings. If accepted, manuscripts will be published in the OUP Journal Bioinformatics. Authors of accepted papers will be required to present their work at the symposium in a talk. Authors of rejected papers will be invited to submit a poster.

### Submission Guidelines

Authors are required to submit a full paper by January 29, 2018  through the <a href="https://www.iscb.org/ismb2018-submit/proceedings">ISMB Proceedings Submission Site</a> and must adhere to the submission guidelines outlined on that site. 

#### **IMPORTANT: During submission please select the general subject of your submissions, and then make sure to <strong>specify BioVis as the "TOPIC" of your submission</strong> to ensure your manuscript is assigned to our COSI.**

We encourage the use of digital video to enhance paper submissions, particularly if part or all of the work addresses interactive techniques. However, please note that OUP does not support videos as supplementary materials, so you will have to host the video elsewhere (e.g., YouTube).

## 2. Abstracts - Submission Deadline: April 5, 2018; Late Poster Submission Deadline: May 1, 2018
Participants are encouraged to submit abstracts describing their unpublished or recently published work related to biological data visualization. Submitters may choose to have their submission reviewed for: talk only, talk and poster, or poster only. If you select talk and poster and are unsuccessful for a talk your abstract will automatically be reviewed for a poster presentation.

### Submission Guidelines

Authors are required to submit an abstract by April 5, 2018 through the [ISMB Abstract Submission Site](https://www.iscb.org/ismb2018-submit/ismb2018-abstracts) and must adhere to the submission guidelines outlined on that site. ISMB will also accept late posters abstracts beginning April 6, 2018.
