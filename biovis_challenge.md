## BioVis Challenges Workshop 
## at IEEE VIS 2019, Vancouver, British Columbia

### Aims, Scope & Objectives
The rapidly expanding field of biology creates enormous challenges for data visualization techniques that enable researchers to gain insight from their large and highly complex data sets.

The BioVis Interest Group organizes this interdisciplinary workshop at IEEE VIS, covering aspects of visualization in biology. This workshop brings together researchers from the visualization, bioinformatics, and biology communities with the purpose of educating, inspiring, and engaging visualization researchers in problems in biological data visualization. 

### Challenge Formats
Researchers will have two opportunities to participate in this year’s Biovis Challenge. The first is a **Data Challenge** where researchers are tasked to visualize the tree of life, the second opportunity is a **Redesign Challenge** where researchers have the opportunity to propose and present a redesign of a biological data visualization of their choosing.

#### > Data Challenge

*The affinities of all the beings of the same class have sometimes been represented by a great tree. I believe this simile largely speaks the truth.*
— Charles Darwin

Genomic data is enabling researchers to deeply probe the relatedness of different members of the same species in addition to comparing higher order hierarchical structures between different species. Taken together, genomic data allows us to approximate a tree of life that showcases the relationships of living things. This year’s Biovis challenge will task researchers to visualize this tree of life using data from the [RefSeq database]( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/refseq/about/). To help researchers with this daunting task, we will be releasing a dataset for analysis and visualization (refer to the background reading for more information).

Submissions to the biovis challenge should be in the form of an open source interactive data visualization, for which we will release additional detailed requirements shortly.

**Background Reading:**

Our dataset comes from the following prior publication:


>Mash: fast genome and metagenome distance estimation using MinHash.
>Brian D. Ondov,Todd J. Treangen, Páll Melsted, Adam B. Mallonee, Nicholas H. Bergman, Sergey Koren and Adam M. Phillippy 
>Genome Biology201617:132 doi : [https://doi.org/10.1186/s13059-016-0997-x]( https://doi.org/10.1186/s13059-016-0997-x )


Although the primary focus of this public is the introduction of a rapidly computable distance metric for genomic data, the focus of this challenge is  Figure 3, which visualizes a hierarchical network of the RefSeq database genomes using the MASH results. Reading this background paper should provide you with an intuition about the dataset and how you might use the properties in this dataset 

**Important Dates:**

Dataset release and additional challenge details: Mid-May 2019

Submissions Open: June 2019

Submission Closes: August 2019

Notification of Status: ~ Mid to late August 2019

#### > Redesign Challenge

Have you seen a commonly used biomedical data visualization that could be a lot better? Do you have an example of a time you’ve redesigned a data visualization that improved engagement? If so, the redesign challenge is your opportunity to tell that story!  

We invited members of the biomedical and data visualization research communities to submit a poster of their redesign process and outcomes. Selected posters will be displayed at the 2019 IEEE VIS conference and the very top posters will be asked to present their work during the Biovis Challenges workshop on Thursday October 24th, 2019.

**Submissions details are coming shortly, to receive additional notifications about our biovis redesign challenge please sign up here:** [https://forms.gle/dM7rqdfwTgq6R72C9](https://forms.gle/dM7rqdfwTgq6R72C9)

**Important Dates:**

Submissions Open: June 2019

Submission Closes: August 2019

Notification of Status : ~ Mid to late August 2019
